## üöÄ What is PAI?

PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) is a powerful framework that enhances AI assistants with:

- **Dynamic Context Loading**: Automatically loads relevant context based on conversation intent
- **Universal Flexible Context (UFC)**: Intelligent context management system
- **Hook System**: Event-driven automation for tool calls
- **Voice Notifications**: AI-powered voice feedback
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different tasks
- **Security First**: Built with security best practices

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Context Intelligence
- Semantic understanding of user intent
- Automatic context loading
- Project-specific knowledge bases
- Dynamic agent selection

### 2. Automation
- Pre and post-execution hooks
- Custom command integration
- Workflow automation
- Event-driven responses

### 3. Voice Integration
- macOS native Premium/Enhanced voices (100% free, offline)
- High-quality neural TTS
- Multiple voice personalities for Kai and agents
- Real-time notifications

### 4. Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection
- No hardcoded secrets

## üîß Environment Variables

PAI uses environment variables for configuration:

- `PAI_DIR`: PAI configuration directory (required)
- `PAI_HOME`: Your home directory (optional, defaults to $HOME)
- `PORT`: Voice server port (default: 8888)
- `DA`: Digital Assistant name (optional, defaults to "Assistant")
- `DA_COLOR`: Display color for your assistant (optional, defaults to "purple")

- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Usage Examples](#usage-examples)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## System Requirements

- macOS 11+ (primary support)
- Bun runtime (for voice server)
- AI assistant access (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)
- macOS 13+ recommended (for Premium/Enhanced voices)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone PAI repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PAI.git
cd PAI

# Set PAI_DIR
export PAI_DIR="$HOME/PAI/PAI_DIRECTORY"

# Install voice server (optional)
cd PAI_DIRECTORY/voice-server
./install.sh

# Configure environment
cp ${PAI_DIR}/env-example ${PAI_DIR}/.env
# Edit ${PAI_DIR}/.env with your settings
```

## Configuration

PAI is configured through:
1. Environment variables in `${PAI_DIR}/.env`
2. Context files in `${PAI_DIR}/context/`
3. Hook scripts in `${PAI_DIR}/hooks/`
4. Project-specific configurations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Context Loading
```bash
# Context automatically loads based on conversation
"Help me with my website" ‚Üí Loads website context
"Research AI trends" ‚Üí Loads research agent
```

### Voice Notifications
```bash
# Send voice notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -d '{"message": "Task completed"}'
```

### Hook System
```yaml
# ${PAI_DIR}/hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh
# Automatically loads context before processing prompts
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Context not loading | Check `${PAI_DIR}/context/` directory exists |
| Voice not working | Verify voice server is running and voices are downloaded |
| Hooks not triggering | Ensure hook scripts are executable |
| Port conflicts | Change PORT in `${PAI_DIR}/.env` |
